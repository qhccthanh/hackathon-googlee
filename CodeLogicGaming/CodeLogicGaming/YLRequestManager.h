//    When you init the YLRequestManager for the first time, a block as a "AuthStateDidChangeListener" will be registered.
//    To be invoked when:
//        - The block is registered as a listener,
//        - The current user changes, or, the current user's access token changes.
//    Remarks:    The block is invoked immediately after adding it according to it's standard invocation semantics, asynchronously on the	 main thread.
//                Users should pay special attention to making sure the block does not inadvertently retain objects which should not be retained by the long-lived block.
//                The block itself will be retained by FIRAuth until it is unregistered or until the FIRAuth instance is otherwise deallocated.
